# The Potential – Multiverse Edition

**A modern rework of a fan-favorite ship, now Multiverse-ready.**

The Potential returns with a fresh look and proper functionality, built specifically for **FTL: Multiverse**. This release includes:

- **Potential MV** – A full reskin of the classic ship, adapted to the Multiverse theme.  
- **Potential Legacy** – The original design, preserved for the purists, now with fixed thruster animations.

Both versions feature updated engine visuals and integrate cleanly with Hyperspace, eliminating previous workarounds like the janky power plant hacks.

---

## Requirements

- **FTL: Multiverse** – This mod depends on textures and features introduced in the Multiverse overhaul.

Standalone support is being considered but isn't available (yet).

---

## Planned Features

- Integration with new Multiverse ship systems.  
- Variants **B** and **C** for the Potential MV.
- A Standalone version that doesn't rely on Multiverse to function.

---

## Installation

1. Install **FTL: Multiverse** if you haven’t already.  
2. Download and load this mod through a mod manager of your choice, *after* Multiverse.
3. Enjoy !

## Notes

Expect infrequent updates, I tend to jump from one project to the next.
